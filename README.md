# Work Day Calendar Planner (UCSD Challenge 5)

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- A simple calendar application with DayJS used for timekeeping.
- You're able to check the current hour, along with the day, and make notes for past, present, and future.
- Using localStorage, you can save your messages for later use/ reference. 

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Access via [Gitpages](epicasino.github.io/Calendar-App/).

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

**Upon first visiting the site, you will be presented with the current time and date, along with time-blocks for a normal 9AM - 5PM work schedule.**

**As you use the website, the current time is updated in real time. You may take notes on any code block, whether it would be in your current hour or not.**
*The current hour will be shaded in red. Future times will be shaded in green, and past hours will be shaded in grey.*

**After making notes, you may click the save icon to the right of the desired time-block you would like to save. NOTE: Using the save button will only affect the same time-block you clicked the button in. In order to save multiple times-blocks, you will need to press each save button per text-box.**

**After refreshing with some saved text, you will still have access to these saved notes for future use.**
